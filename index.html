<p>English is the most spoken language in the United States and it is also true that the majority of citizens speak only english as their native language,however, sixty to seventy-five percent of people in the world speak more than one language. Although most of the world is either bilingual or trilingual and so on the United States citizens have a stigma that english should be the only language spoken. With this strong idea less natural born citizens know another language.As the United States becomes more and more diverse I believe there should be an app or website that help people learn another language in the comfort of their own home.</p>

<p>The mission of this app will be to reduce the stigma in the U.S. of only speaking english and to open the possibility to those who do want to learn another language, they can learn without the fear and pressure of learning with others. Many people want to learn a second language but stop themselves because they don’t want to sound wrong or they are afraid people will laugh.I want to create this app for the purpose of reducing that fear and to make people feel more confident when learning a language. I want this app to be the first app people have in mind when they want a language app instead of apps  such as Duolingo or Rosetta Stone.I have apps such as Duolingo where you learn a language independently but I always lose interest.

This app will be family friendly therefore parents can learn with their kids. The app will include games,lessons from professional language teachers and lessons in the form of notes that you would take in class.There will also be a video chat feature where you can ask to speak with  professors or you can connect with people in the app and study together. There will be a community guideline where you must only video chat with the people in your age range,minors six to 16 must be accompanied by an adult if the video chat will be used.There must not be any  excessive profanity in chat rooms. There are no regional restrictions therefore you can chat with anyone in the world. The cost of the app will be gained through moderate ads that will only show up after or in between games,lessons, and video chats. There are no restrictions to hours users may use the app whenever they want.</p></div>
