<h2> Why is it Important to learn another language in the U.S.?</h2>
<p>English is the most spoken language in the United States and it is also true that the majority of citizens speak only english as their native language,however, sixty to seventy-five percent of people in the world speak more than one language. Although most of the world is either bilingual or trilingual and so on the United States citizens have a stigma that english should be the only language spoken. With this strong idea less natural born citizens know another language.As the United States becomes more and more diverse I believe there should be an app or website that help people learn another language in the comfort of their own home.</p>
